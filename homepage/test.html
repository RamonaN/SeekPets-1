<p><span style="font-family: 'Montserrat Bold';font-weight:bold">Update Your Pet’s Microchip</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Montserrat Light';">Often times pets come into the shelter with a microchip, but the contact information is not updated or the microchip is not registered. Make sure your information is updated by calling your pet’s microchip company, or using free microchip databases such as <a href="http://www.found.org">found.org</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Montserrat Bold'; font-weight:bold">File a Lost Pet Report</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Montserrat Light';">Call 311 to report your lost pet. The dispatcher will request your pet’s microchip number, your contact information and a description of your pet to create a Lost Pet Report in our database. This will ensure we have the right information on file in the chance your pet is found by an Animal Protection Officer or a member of the community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Montserrat Bold';font-weight:bold">Hang Posters &amp; Flyers</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Montserrat Light';">Hang lost pet posters in your neighborhood, at local grooming shops, pet supply stores and veterinarian offices. You can also hang flyers at the Animal Services Center as well, just ask a Customer Service team member for more information.</span></p>         </div>
